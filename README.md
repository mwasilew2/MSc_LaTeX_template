# MSc_LaTeX_template

DISCLAIMER:
This is NOT an official repository by University of Edinburgh. I am NOT an employee/researcher from University of Edinburgh and no one from the University verified this repo. I do NOT provide support. I do NOT take responsibility for this template or anything that you do with it. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I was a student at School of Informatics and it took me a while to setup everything. The idea is to help you with that so that you can focus on writing your dissertation.

The template comes from here: http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/systems/tex/informatics/infthesis/

The class file (necessary to run this template on your local computer) comes from a flash drive that was circulating among students. I could not verify its integrity, but I used it in my dissertation and it worked.


HOW TO:
Step 1:
Create an account on Github (skip this step if you already have one).

Step 2:
Fork this repo (this will create your "copy" of it).

Step 3:
Clone repo to your machine (DICE machine or your laptop).

Step 4:
Edit files locally (e.g. using Texmaker on a DICE machine). Commit. Pull. Push. (see notes below for git tutorials)


LATEX: Dice machines come pre-installed with everything you will need (class files, LaTeX compiler, editor). You can start working straight away.

OTHER NOTES/IDEAS/THINGS THAT MIGHT HELP YOU:

- use package manager for installing LaTeX packages (e.g. yum install texlive-sectsty)
- you can use ssh keys for authenticating with Github. Here's a handy guide: http://martin.kleppmann.com/2013/05/24/improving-security-of-ssh-private-keys.html
